## Hello There! 👋

Welcome to my personal cybersecurity blog! This is my first post marking the beginning of a journey where I'll share insights about **penetration testing**, **offensive security**, and **ethical hacking**.

## Why I Created This Blog?

I'm currently a 3rd-year **Information Security** student at **FPT University Hanoi**. Throughout my learning journey and hands-on lab work, I've realized that:

### 1. **Writing Deepens Understanding**
When you write about what you've learned, you're forced to truly understand it. Many times I thought I understood something, but when I sat down to write about it, I discovered gaps in my knowledge.

### 2. **Teaching is the Best Way to Learn**
> "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - Albert Einstein

Each blog post is an opportunity for me to consolidate knowledge while helping others on the same path.

### 3. **Building a Real-World Portfolio**
In cybersecurity, having a portfolio demonstrating practical skills matters more than certifications alone. This blog is where I document my projects, findings, and lessons learned.

## Who Am I?

I'm **Duc**, a student passionate about **penetration testing** and **offensive security**. Rather than just learning theory, I believe in:

> **"Learn by Doing"** - Hands-on practice over passive reading

### What I'm Currently Doing:

🎯 **Building Home Labs**
- Vulnerable web application environments (DVWA, bWAPP, OWASP Juice Shop)
- Active Directory pentesting lab with multiple domains
- Network penetration testing environment with Kali Linux

🔴 **Continuous Practice**
- **TryHackMe**: Focusing on penetration testing paths and offensive security rooms
- **Hack The Box**: Pwning machines and solving challenges for real-world scenarios
- **PortSwigger Web Security Academy**: Mastering web application vulnerabilities
- **Bug Bounty Platforms**: Starting with HackerOne and Bugcrowd

📚 **Learning & Certifications**
- Completed: Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
- In Progress: **Web Penetration Testing 101** (CyberJutsu Academy)
- Planning: eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester)
- Future Goal: OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)

## What Will This Blog Cover?

I'll focus on the following topics:

### 🔴 Penetration Testing Fundamentals

- Book reviews and resource recommendations

## My Writing Style

I'll aim to write in a style that's:

✅ **Practical and Detailed** - Every post includes screenshots, commands, and step-by-step reproduction

✅ **Easy to Understand** - Complex concepts explained in simple terms with real-world examples

✅ **Actionable** - Focus on skills you can immediately apply in your pentesting workflow

✅ **Honest** - Not afraid to share mistakes and lessons learned from failures

- 📖 Maybe write a technical book on offensive security

## My Learning Philosophy

I follow these principles in my pentesting journey:

### 🎯 Focus on Fundamentals
Before jumping into advanced techniques, I make sure I understand the basics deeply. Why does SQL injection work? How does TCP/IP actually function? Understanding the "why" helps you adapt when things don't work as expected.

### 🔄 Consistent Practice
I dedicate at least **2-3 hours daily** to hands-on practice. Whether it's a HTB machine, a CTF challenge, or building a new lab, consistency beats intensity.

### 📝 Document Everything
Every successful exploit, every failed attempt, every interesting finding gets documented. This creates a personal knowledge base I can reference later.

### 🤝 Engage with Community
Learning in isolation is hard. I actively participate in Discord servers, forums, and local meetups. Teaching others reinforces my own understanding.

### ⚖️ Ethical Mindset
Penetration testing skills come with responsibility. I always:
- Get proper authorization before testing
- Respect scope and rules of engagement
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly
- Never use skills for malicious purposes

## What Makes Me Different?

There are thousands of pentesting blogs out there. Here's what I hope makes mine unique:

### 🎓 Student Perspective
I'm learning in real-time. My posts reflect the struggles, questions, and "aha!" moments that students face. No pretending to be an expert – just authentic learning.

### 🔬 Lab-Focused Approach
Every technique I write about, I've tested in my own lab. I include full lab setup instructions so readers can reproduce everything.

### 🌏 Southeast Asian Context
Most pentesting content comes from Western perspectives. I'll share insights relevant to SEA region, including local vulnerabilities, regional bug bounty tips, and cultural considerations.

### 💰 Budget-Conscious
I'm a student with limited budget. All my labs use free or student-licensed tools. I'll show how to learn pentesting without spending thousands of dollars.

## Closing Thoughts

Thank you for taking the time to read my first post! I know the path to becoming a **professional Penetration Tester** isn't easy, but I believe that with persistence, passion, and the right methodology, anything is possible.

This blog isn't just about sharing knowledge – it's a journal documenting my own learning journey. If you're on a similar path, let's connect and learn together!

## Coming Up Next

In my next post, I'll provide a comprehensive guide on **Building Your First Penetration Testing Lab**, covering:
- Hardware requirements and virtualization setup
- Installing Kali Linux and essential tools
- Setting up vulnerable targets (DVWA, Metasploitable, VulnHub VMs)
- Network configuration for isolated testing
- Best practices for safe pentesting practice

Stay tuned! 🚀
